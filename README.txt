# 480-MusicManager

To set up and install the Music Manager project, please follow the guide in the Database Initialization Instructions and Application Installation Instructions pdfs.

Upon starting the application, you will be brought to a title screen which will contain a text box to input a Username, a Password, a Database Username, and a Database Password.
For the Username, for testing purposes, input Admin and for the Password, input Password.
For the Database Username, input your database name, typically called root, and your database password. This should bring you to the next scene.

In this next scene, you will see 3 textboxes labeled Artist, Song Name, and Year. For testing purposes, we used Frank Ocean as the artist, Pretty Sweet as the Song Name, and 2016 as the year.
There is also a search button, a Recommendations button, two text fields, and a dropdown menu.
First, input the artist, song name, and/or year that you want to search for.
Second, press search which should show a list of results in the left box.
Third, select the song which you want to see recommendations for by clicking on the song in the left box.
Next, select which option you want for the dropdown menu.
Each option will correlate to the recommendations search in that it will bias that search to the option selected.
Last, select the recommendations button to receive a random list of results that are biased by your search parameter.
Each time the recommendations button is selected, a new set of results will be shown.
There is also a I am Feeling Groovy option if you scroll down on the dropdown menu which will show options that are based closely to your song
in which to get your groove on.
